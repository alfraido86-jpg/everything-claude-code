# Run Report

## Overview
This document provides a template and guidelines for documenting migration runs, configuration changes, and acceptance test results.

## Report Metadata

```
Run ID: RUN-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]
Date: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
Operator: [username]
Environment: [Development/Staging/Production]
```

## System Configuration

### Paths (Use $HOME for Portability)

**Important**: Always use `$HOME` variable instead of hardcoded `/Users/username` paths to ensure case-insensitivity and portability on macOS and Linux.

#### Correct Path Format
```
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
$HOME/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
$HOME/projects/workspace
$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts
```

#### Incorrect Path Format (Avoid)
```
/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
/users/username/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
/Users/JohnDoe/projects/workspace
```

### Why Use $HOME?

1. **Case-Insensitivity**: macOS filesystem can be case-insensitive or case-sensitive
   - `/Users/` vs `/users/` - using `$HOME` eliminates this issue
   
2. **Portability**: Scripts work across different users and systems
   
3. **Consistency**: Maintains consistent paths in documentation and scripts

4. **Security**: Doesn't expose specific usernames in shared documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Use $HOME**: Always use `$HOME` variable in path references
2. **ISO 8601 Timestamps**: Use standard timestamp format
3. **Complete Records**: Document all steps, even skipped ones
4. **Backup References**: Always record backup locations
5. **Issue Tracking**: Log all issues, even minor ones
6. **Security Focus**: Include security audit in every run
7. **Rollback Ready**: Maintain rollback information
8. **Version Everything**: Record all tool versions

## Path Variable Reference

Common path patterns using $HOME:

```bash
# macOS
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/
$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/
$HOME/.ssh/
$HOME/Documents/
$HOME/projects/

# Linux
$HOME/.config/Claude/
$HOME/.config/google-chrome/
$HOME/.ssh/
$HOME/documents/
$HOME/projects/

# Cross-platform
$HOME/backups/
$HOME/temp/
$HOME/bin/
```

## Automation Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# run-report-generator.sh

REPORT_FILE="$HOME/reports/run-report-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md"
mkdir -p "$HOME/reports"

{
    echo "# Run Report"
    echo ""
    echo "Run ID: RUN-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
    echo "Date: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
    echo "Operator: $USER"
    echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
    echo ""
    
    echo "## System Information"
    sw_vers 2>/dev/null || cat /etc/os-release
    echo ""
    
    echo "## Tool Versions"
    echo "Claude Desktop: $(defaults read /Applications/Claude.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A')"
    echo "Claude Code: $(claude --version 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A')"
    echo "Chrome: $(/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --version 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A')"
    echo ""
    
    # Add more sections as needed
    
} > "$REPORT_FILE"

echo "Report generated: $REPORT_FILE"
```
